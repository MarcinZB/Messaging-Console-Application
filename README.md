# Simple messenger
The "Messaging Console Application" is a command-line application designed to facilitate seamless message exchange between users. The project's primary goal is to provide users with a straightforward and efficient way to communicate through the command line. The application includes the following core functionalities:

Display Messages:
Users can execute the application with the appropriate command to view a list of all messages directed to them. This feature enables users to stay updated on their incoming messages.

Send Messages:
The application allows users to send messages to other users by specifying the recipient's username, composing the message, and confirming their identity with the provided password.

Additionally, the application incorporates robust security measures to ensure user validation. It verifies the existence of the specified user and validates the provided password before allowing access to the messaging functionality.

Technology Stack:
The "Messaging Console Application" is built using the Python programming language. Python's versatility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for implementing the application's command-line functionalities. Furthermore, to handle data storage and management, the application utilizes the PostgreSQL database. This database technology ensures efficient and reliable storage of messages and user information.

The combination of Python for application logic and PostgreSQL for data storage results in a well-rounded solution that offers secure messaging capabilities and enhances user communication through a command-line interface.
